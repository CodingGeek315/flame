# My first flame project ðŸ’©

I'm working on a flame project, will update here when I have new stuff

TIL:
1. Code is just one big pattern.
2. CSS can sometimes feel like digital wielding.
3. Good projects take days to do, not just one.
4. If you are making coding complicated, then it will be complicated. If you go in thinking it will be easy, it most likely will be.
5. There is plenty of help out there.
6. Using the internet to "cheat" is "sometimes" okay.

TIL:
1. How to change specific parts of an image.
2. How to locate certain parts of an image.
3. Making something yours is fun.
4. Purple fire looks cool.
5. Even a computer-generated fire has to be proportional.
